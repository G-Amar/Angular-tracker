## Project Overview

This is a front-end Angular project that I created to learn various aspects of Angular and Firebase, including components, routing, guards, authentication, and Firestore (CRUD operations).

The project aims to demonstrate the following features and concepts:

- Angular components: Understand the basics of Angular components and their role in building the user interface.
- Angular routing: Implement client-side navigation using Angular Router to navigate between different views.
- Route guards: Utilize route guards to protect certain routes based on authentication status and redirect to login page.
- Firebase authentication: Implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication service, allowing users to sign up, log in, and protect certain areas of the application.
- Firestore integration: Utilize Firebase Firestore for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data, demonstrating the basic usage of Firestore in an Angular application.
